We release a strong open-set object detection model [**Grounding DINO**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499) that achieves the best results on open-set object detection tasks. It achieves **52.5 zero-shot** AP on COCO detection, without any COCO training data! It achieves **63.0** AP on COCO after fine-tuning. Code and checkpoints will be available [here](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO).
