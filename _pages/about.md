Hi! This is Shilong Liu (刘世隆). I'm a `ceil(now() - 2020.9)`th year Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/index.html), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Zhang](https://www.leizhang.org/), Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/), and Prof. [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). I got my bachelor's degree from the [Department of Industrial Engineering](http://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2020. 

I am a research intern at NVIDIA. I was an intern of computer vision at [International Digital Economy Academy (IDEA)](https://idea.edu.cn/) in most of my PhD times, under the supervision of [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://www.leizhang.org/). I was a summer intern at [Microsoft Research, Redmond]() in June to Septemeber 2023, under the supervision of Dr. [Chunyuan Li](https://chunyuan.li/) and Dr. [Hao Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/hcheng2site). I have a close collaboration with Dr. [Jianwei Yang](https://jwyang.github.io/) as well.

My previous work focused on computer vision, particularly object detection and multi-modal learning. Here are some of my representative works:

- Detection Transformers: We proposed a series of improvements on Detection Transformer including [DAB-DETR](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DAB-DETR)<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-Research/DAB-DETR" alt="GitHub stars">, [DN-DETR](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DN-DETR)<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-Research/DN-DETR" alt="GitHub stars">, [DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO)<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-Research/DINO" alt="GitHub stars">, [MaskDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/MaskDINO)<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-Research/MaskDINO" alt="GitHub stars">, and [Stable-DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Stable-DINO)<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-Research/Stable-DINO" alt="GitHub stars">. Notably, [DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO) was the **FIRST** DETR-like model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the COCO object detection leaderboard.

- Open-world Object Detection: Our innovative models [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO)<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO" alt="GitHub stars">, [Grounded-SAM](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything)<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything" alt="GitHub stars">, and [Grounding-DINO-1.5](https://deepdataspace.com/) have made significant strides in this field. Grounding DINO has become one of the most popular open-world object detection models, enabling us to DETECT and SEGMENT ANYTHING.

- Multi-modal Agents: We introduced [LLaVA-Plus](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-Plus-Codebase), which enhances multi-modal large language models with visual expertise.
